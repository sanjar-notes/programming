# programming (long: Computer programming)
- A high level view about programming. Its use, need and implementation scenarios.
- basics
- fp, oop, conventions etc
  - I prefer the brevity, cleanliness and readability of code with a functional programming style using map, filter and reduce.
  - I have also found that functional programming can help solve many of the problems with concurrent systems.
  - I wish to learn more about it, both to write awesome and efficient code.
